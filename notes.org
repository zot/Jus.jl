* Commands
Monitored values are pushed
** 'set' [[-c] [[-m path] | [path value]]] ...
** 'get' path ...
** 'observe' [true | false] varid ...
* Metadata (these are all maintained by normal handlers)
** create: create data of the given type when the variable is created
** priority: =high=, =normal=, or =low= -- when to process values for this variable in a batch
** presenter: on creation, replace the value with the results of the constructor on the value
useful when combined with =path=
** transformer: transforms values of child variables with this transformerId
** transformerId: cue to ancestor to transform this variable's value
** type: the value's type
** viewdefs: manage a set of viewdef variables named with =type, namespace=
keep it properly stocked by monitoring =type= metadata values
** path: use the object model for values
*** the special value =.= means to keep the existing value
a leading =.= will be stripped if a value is given
*** space separated fields and/or functions: =a b() c() d=
*** function path elements: =a f() g()=
- functions in the first or middle positions should handle one argument
- a function in the last position
  - =nothing= will be returned if it does not take one argument or does not have read access
  - setting will have no effect if it does not take two arguments or does not have write access
** access = action | r | w | rw -- metadata that determines accessibility for the path
action means write-only, path must be a function, and no value will be sent to the function
* Security
** sensitive metadata
The server can scrape and create template variables to prevent paths from leaking over connections
