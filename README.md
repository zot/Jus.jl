# Jus

*Jus (n): essence, juice, black coffee, electicity*

Jus is a presentation engine for Julia to support "no-code

```sh
./sample 2

A frontend can be autogenerated (for the ultimate no-code experience)

no JS required).

# Other Frontends

Frontending Jus requires an agent for that frontend. The
